* Shapes should not know thier own world location or rotation, should be in a transform struct/class
* Implement Hull fully
* Implement Capsule fully
* Implement SAT and/or GJK for overlap test
* More intermediate primitive tests such as distance line segment to line segment -> new separate static tests class?
* Draw Method for general shapes, shapes will not have their own draw methods as they are hitboxes! drawing for debug only.. -> make class!
